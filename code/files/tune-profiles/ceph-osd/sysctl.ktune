# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire

# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.

# PID allocation wrap value.  When the kernel's next PID value
# reaches this value, it wraps back to a minimum PID value.
# PIDs of value pid_max or larger are not allocated.

# e.g., a box with 32 cpus, the default of 32768 is reasonable, for 64 cpus,
# 65536, for 4096 cpus, 4194304 (which is the upper limit possible).
